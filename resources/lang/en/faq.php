    'faq'  => ' FAQ',
    'faq1' => ' Is there a difference between ‘salt chlorinator’ chlorine and ‘normal’chlorine',
    'aws1' => ' A salt chlorinator makes chlorine the same way a chlorine factory does. The
               difference is that it is manufactured in your pool. Liquid chlorine is
               approximately 12.5% pure, whereas PURACHLOR chlorine is 100% pure.',

    'faq2' => ' What type of salt should I use?',
    'aws2' => ' High purity salt such as natural salts are essential, it is important that the salt does not contain                  additives. Any common salt (like table salt) usually has an additive that may have staining properties.',

    'faq3' => ' Will I ever need to add standard pool chlorine again?',
    'aws3' => ' From time to time it may become necessary to add some chlorine to the pool. This may be due to heavy rain             or if the chlorine level needs to be shocked back up.',

    'faq4' => ' Does the salt damage pool equipment?',
    'aws4' => ' No. Low levels of salt have relatively insignificant corrosive effects on pool fittings and equipment',

    'faq5' => ' How much salt will I need?',
    'aws5' => ' 1 kg of salt in 1,000 litres of water raises the salt level by 1,000ppm. Therefore, 420 kg of salt will               raise a 70,000 litres pool from 0 ppm to 6,000 ppm.',

    'faq6' => ' Is it like swimming in the ocean?',
    'aws6' => ' No, the ocean has from 35,000ppm up to 50,000ppm of salt in the water, while a saltwater pool has only                about 3000 parts per million salt. At 3000 ppm, you generally cannot even taste the salt. Any water under             6000 ppm is still considered fresh water. Your eye contains about 9000 ppm salt.',

    'faq7' => ' Is the pool water still blue?',
    'aws7' => ' Yes, since the salt water system creates chlorine, the water is still blue and also very clear. A salt                system gives your pool the best water quality you have ever seen.',

    'faq8' => ' Can I install it with my existing pool equipment?',
    'aws8' => ' Yes, since the water is still considered fresh water, it is compatible with all standard pool equipment               (pumps filters, heaters, poolsweeps, etc.) If you have a stainless steel filter, check with the                       manufacturer.',
    'faq9' => ' Does this soften the pool water?',
    'aws9' => ' Yes, since the water is still considered fresh water, it is compatible with all standard pool equipment               (pumps filters, heaters, poolsweeps, etc.) If you have a stainless steel filter, check with the                       manufacturer.',

    'faq10' => ' Is it corrosive',
    'aws10' => ' It is mildly corrosive, but as all chlorine is made from salt, conventionally chlorinated water is                    corrosive too. Whereas saline water has no harmful effects at all, impurities in chemical chlorine can                damage pool surfaces. Our filters and pumps are not affected by mildly saline water, and carry                        warranties to that effect.',
    'faq11' => ' How Does Salt Chlorination Work',
    'aws11' => ' Mass chlorine production in huge chlorine factories uses exactly the same basic technique as is used by               a chlorinator. This technique involves the passage of electric current through salty water to produce                 chlorine.
                 Salt systems have three main components.
                 The first component is plain old salt. You have to have a minimum level of about 3000 ppm of salt in the pool water. Salt makes the water conductive so that the electricity can pass between the plates in the cell. If the salt level goes too low, the chlorine production simply stops. Salt is also the raw material from which the chlorine is produced.
                 The control unit is a device that sends power to the salt cell. The unit controls how much chlorine is produced by regulating how long the power is applied to the cell.
                 The salt cell is a series of plates with opposite charges in a cell. As the water passes between the plates, electrolysis takes place, releasing the chlorine in the salt. (NaCl – NaOCl – NaCl). No salt is lost in this process.',
    'faq12' => ' What are the 84 minerals in PURASALTS',

        'aws13' => ' The benefits are numerous. PURASALTS Minerale Crystal salt has a tremendous power to transform. From              a scientific view, salt has a unique property. Unlike other crystalline structures that are                       molecular, salt’s atomic structure is electrical. That is why salt is so transformable. It has the                ability to give up or surrender its material structure and transform into something electrical,                   ions. When we combine salt with water, the salt dissolves and the minerals that are hidden inside                 the cubic form are released as ions, both positively and negatively charged particles.s',

        'aws16'   => ' The lights on the smart box will actually work out the ppm automatically. However should the ppm                  be too high you have the option to turn the Oxidation back down to the 7/8th green led(optimumrange).
                       When the minerale ppm drops away over time and gets below the 7th led light after you have turned it down then the machine will register and start reducing its LEDs automatically down letting the user know its time to add more minerale. The only time the smart box LED’s will go back up again after you have turned it down to your set point, is if someone adds more minerale again otherwise it will stay at your reduced set point even though the minerale level is too high. It holds memory of the last reading before you turned it down and when its testing every minute if it notices an increase only then will it increase the led again.(Hence its called a smart box).',
